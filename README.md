# 🚢 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Objective
Perform an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to extract insights, identify trends, and uncover patterns related to passenger survival.

---

## 📁 Dataset Contents
- `train.csv`: Main dataset for training and analysis (includes survival outcomes).
- `test.csv`: Data for testing predictions (no survival outcome).
- `gender_submission.csv`: Example submission for Kaggle.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🔍 EDA Tasks Completed

### ✅ Basic Exploration
- `.info()`, `.describe()`, `.value_counts()` to understand structure
- Checked for missing values
- Identified categorical and numerical features

### 📊 Visualizations
- **Histograms**: Age, Fare, SibSp, Parch
- **Boxplots**: Relationship of numerical features with survival
- **(Planned)**: Pairplot and heatmap for correlation & multivariate analysis

### 📈 Key Findings
- Younger passengers had higher survival rates
- Higher fare correlates with better survival
- Moderate family size increased survival chances
- Heavy missing data in `Cabin` column

---

## 📄 Output Files
- `Titanic_EDA.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with code and visuals

---

## 🎯 Outcome
- Gained practical EDA experience using visual and statistical tools
- Built foundational insight into the Titanic survival problem
